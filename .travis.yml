# Travis-CI Build
# Many thanks to the keyczar-dotnet project for initial inspiration.
# Our contribution:
#  - Handles both Mono 2 and 3 installation, generically, in an OS X worker
#  - Unbundles the NuGet.exe setup (no binary dependencies carried)
#  - Verifies NuGet.exe dependencies are present
#  - Discovers and runs our unit tests

language: objective-c

env:
 global:
  - EnableNuGetPackageRestore=true 
 matrix:
  - MONO_SCRIPT="3" MONO_VER="3.10.0"
  - MONO_SCRIPT="2" MONO_VER="2.10.11"

# Mono distributes OS X binaries as pkg (for v2) and dmg (for v3)
# So we need to have separate scripts to download and install it in the Travis worker

before_install:
 - sh .ci/install-mono-${MONO_SCRIPT}.sh ${MONO_VER}
 - find /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework -name Microsoft.Build.dll

script:
 - xbuild /verbosity:quiet
 - sh .ci/RunTests.sh 

branches:
 only:
  - master
